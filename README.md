# lottery-component

A web component that displays the latest Icelandic lottery numbers. The
component utilizes data provided by [apis.is](http://apis.is).

[Check out the demo](https://koddsson.github.io/lottery-component).

Note that this is a quick and ugly implementation so I could learn native web
components better. If you'd like to yell at me for my bad code/style, you can
do so [here](https://twitter.com/koddsson).
